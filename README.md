This is a command-line finance tool meant primarily for personal use. The syntax of the command inputs is influenced heavily by [beancount](https://github.com/beancount/beancount), a more robust finance CLI tool.

## Purpose

This is a great tool if you are not interested in all the bells and whistles of complicated CLI finance tools. There is little syntax to learn and your input format is an open road. Cobblepot has simple syntax with detailed help text from the command line. You can generate reports and summaries at any moment without becoming confused by the variety.
